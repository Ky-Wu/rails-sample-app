<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  My name is Kyle Wu. I'm a hobby web developer that is trying to learn
  more about Ruby on Rails. I developed this application through Michael Hartl's
 <i> Ruby on Rails Tutorial</i>, which is a fantastic educational tool that allows readers
  to truly learn through interaction.

  The <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/"><em>Ruby on Rails
  Tutorial</em></a> is a
  <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">book</a> and
  <a href="http://screencasts.railstutorial.org/">screencast series</a>
  to teach web development with
